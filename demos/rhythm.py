''' 
idea: have a buffer note which is the prev note, whenever current note != buffer, add a tuple which is 
(prev note, buffer) to the array and reset the timer and buffer

or triple since multiple notes could happen at once. so whenver a new one is detected, add a triple
which is (note, note_start, note_length) to the array.
